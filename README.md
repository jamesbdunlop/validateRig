# validateRig

### Aims:

    - To create an API/UI that creates a validation of a rig's default
     value for controls, and connections information to validate.
    
    - Serialize data to disk and load this at anytime to validate the rig
    is still consistent with this data (before delivery).
    
    - Easy setup of source ---> destination .attributes and their 
    anticipated state.
    
    - Easy library management of validation states for different rigs.
